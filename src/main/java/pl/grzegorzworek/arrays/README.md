# Arrays

## Task 1

In the `Task01.java` file:

1. create a 50-element array called `mainTab` with consecutive integers from 0 to 49,
2. print the elements of this array on the console one by one, ten in each line,
3. for one-digit numbers, complete with an additional zero at the beginning (e.g. 03).

```
00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,
40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,
```

## Task 2

In the `Task02.java` file:

1. using the `for` loop, create an array called `randNumbers`, containing 20 random numbers from the `0-100` range (use the method described in the snippets to get a random value),
2. print the minimum value from the table in the console.
